1. Introduction
In today's distributed fintech ecosystems, real-time fraud detection has become crucial to safeguard financial transactions. This documentation presents a prototype of a real-time fraud detection system developed in Java. The system can analyze transactions across various services to identify fraudulent activities without relying on external anomaly detection libraries.

2. Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a prototype of a real-time fraud detection system capable of:

Processing a stream of transactions in real time.
We are identifying fraudulent patterns, such as rapid transactions across services, unusually high transaction amounts, and irregular sequences of transactions.
I am generating alerts for suspicious activities.
Handling out-of-order events efficiently in a distributed system.


3. Logic Overview
   Fraud Detector Engine
   The fraud detection logic is implemented in the FraudDetectorEngineServiceImpl class. 
    Key components of the logic include:
High Transaction Amount Detection: Detects transactions that are significantly higher than the user's average transaction amount in the last 24 hours.
Multiple Service Transaction Detection: Identifies users conducting transactions in more than three distinct services within a five-minute window.
Ping-Pong Activity Detection: Flags users engaged in ping-pong activity, where transactions bounce back and forth between two services within ten minutes.

4. Implementation Details


The system architecture is composed of the following components:

TransactionDetails: Represents a transaction event with timestamp, transaction amount, user ID, and service ID.
AlertResponse: Represents an alert generated by the system, including the user ID, alert name, alert message, and timestamp.
AlertGenerator: Generates alerts based on detected fraudulent patterns.
FraudDetectorEngine: Orchestrates the fraud detection process.


5. Routes and API Endpoints
The system exposes the following API endpoints:

GET <a>/api/v1/fraud/all-fraud:</a> Endpoint to check all fraud transactions.
GET <a>/api/v1/fraud/download-csv:</a>  Endpoint to export transactions to CSV format.


6. Setup and Execution
To set up and execute the system, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository.
Build the project using Maven or your preferred build tool.
Run the application on a Java-compatible runtime environment.
Access the provided API endpoints to check fraud transactions and export data-of-order events efficiently in a distributed system.


7. Assumptions
The system assumes transactions are received in real-time or near real-time.
Simulated data is used for testing purposes.
Network latencies and out-of-order events are handled efficiently within the system.


Conclusion
This documentation provides an overview of the real-time fraud detection system prototype developed in Java. The system demonstrates efficient fraud detection logic without relying on external anomaly detection libraries.
